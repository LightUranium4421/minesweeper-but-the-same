## Edit settings, such as asset pack and mine count in **config.json**.

### To create texture packs:
1. Create folder inside **Assets** with a name
2. Add any number of sprites into it, make sure to have their names be the same as the default asset pack (higher image sizes will cause more lag)
3. Set the **config.json** asset pack to the new texture pack name. Unmade textures will default to the base asset pack.

### Setup:
1. Install **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install **Pygame, Numpy, Json, Threading** modules
